# MPI
(IN PROGRESS)

Implementations of useful calculations that could be done with MPI.
These are usually very computaitonally intensive and time consuming on a single processor but using parellization makes it faster for bigger amounts of data.

## NOTE: I'll try keep this repo alive and updated as much as I can. The main problem for me is to calculations that can be done in parallel so any suggestions are welcomed and are much appreciated.
